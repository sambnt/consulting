        Hi, I'm Samuel Bennett.
      </h1>

      <p>
        I run a software design consultancy building boutique software systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm different because my first priority is understanding your needs. I'm not here to sell you something you don't want. I'm not here to frustrate you with unwieldy technology and unreliable software.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm here to understand your problem, and work with you to find a solution. With my experience in the technology industry, I know the lay of the land. I can chart a course to meet your needs at a price you can afford.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like this website, I believe you can get a lot done with a little.
      </p>

      <p>
        From idea, to solution, to support - I'm with you the whole way.
      </p>
